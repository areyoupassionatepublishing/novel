                            <p class="chapter-subtitle-text">Yulia</p>
                            <p class="chapter-text">Yulia, sitting by the edge of the pool and with her slender legs resting in the cool water felt intoxicated by the strange exoticism of her surroundings. But more so by the presence of the man in the pool as he swam through the water towards her with an intense smile curled onto his lips. She was not sure how she had arrived here exactly, sitting by the pool under the hot morning sun at the age of 52 years old, wearing the most daring bikini she had the courage to choose and hoping that this man, 21 years younger than her and now gliding gracefully through the water, would kiss her for the first time since they had met. ‘Of course he will kiss you’, she thought to herself, giving him a modest but confident look. She knew he desired her, but no man had looked at her with that kind of want in such a long time and the excitement of the impending moment made her body tingle with pleasure. She had met him on an international dating site for Ukrainian women and when he messaged her and asked her if she believed it was possible to feel a connection to someone she had never met, someone who was living thousands of miles away in another country, and to feel a connection to them by just looking at a photograph and reading their words, did she think that was possible? Because he said he would not have believed it until he saw her profile. She knew that something special and dangerous was about to happen in her life. And here it was coming to pass. This man, the man who was not her husband was about to kiss her. It was inevitable from the moment she first read his words and looked into his deep eyes. She felt it even then that this man, Dan was name, would kiss her. But more than that, she felt that she would love it. It was because of the nature of their conversations, looking down a web camera at his soft blue eyes and round lips and his earnest, handsome face as she blushed with the intensity of his questions. They spoke for many hours, but always about the same thing, about passion, and whether or not there is a limit to it.</p> 
                            <br>
                            <p class="chapter-text">He finally made it to her, placing his hands powerfully on the ledge of the pool as Yulia widened her legs to allow him to press against the edge just inches from her as he moved between her legs. She couldn’t help but to look down at his lean, toned physique. He was not a big man, but he looked lean and toned as his muscles hardened at the pressure in his hands still pressing down onto the ledge and holding his body in place in front of her. She wanted to be calm and allow her hands to remain down by her sides teasing him in her passivity to his presence, but she subconsciously moved them upwards and placed them on his abdominal muscles, holding his hard body gently as he sprawled before her. He asked her a simple question. It was the same question she had put on the handle of her profile. Saying her name, ‘Yulia’, he asked her, ‘are you passionate?’ He did not wait for a response, softly pressing his lips against hers’. She could feel her body melting in his presence. He was strong and confident and yet he had the softest lips. His second kiss was a little firmer as he open his mouth a little and she felt his liquid tongue touching hers’ briefly. She knew he was simply testing her willingness to kiss him, and when the third kiss came it was stronger as he placed his tongue firmly in her mouth, Yulia, allowing her own tongue to slither around his in a prolonged and passionate kiss. She could feel her hips squirm forward in search of his form as she leaned into him, searching for a closer embrace and feeling his hard chest pressing against her soft breasts. When their lips parted she embraced him and he buried his mouth in her neck. She felt his tongue leaving a wet trail on her neck and up under her ear. She felt her body ache for more of him. But he wanted to take his time and savour every moment of contact with her.</p>

                        <div class="mySlides">
                            <p class="chapter-text">‘How can I be here experiencing this bliss’, she thought to herself. Online dating was not really something she was serious about, which is why she joined an international rather than local agency. But her life lacked the spark of romance and she too often found herself fantasising about starting a new life with a man who truly cared for her. A man unlike her husband, one absent of violence. And so she joined the site, uploaded her photos and began looking at the profiles of foreign men. When she started to receive messages from men she felt flattered and excited, but it was still a brief folly for her. Most of the men on the site were older, and most of them too overweight and out of shape to really excite Yulia. She played with the idea of meeting a man of similar age to her, maybe someone that was married also. A lonely man in a similar position that she could talk to. But the men that contacted her were nothing like what she had dreamed. She could not tell which of them was serious and which of them was just looking for cheap entertainment. Some men sent her messages complimenting her looks which flattered her even if what they said was predictable, uttering silly compliments about how young she looked and how beautiful she appeared. But these same men would then start writing about all of the things they would like to do to her. It was always things they wanted to do ‘to’ her rather than what they wanted to do ‘with’ her. They would ask if she swallowed, or if she was shaved, or if she liked anal and was into being dominated. ‘Disgusting’, she thought looking at these bald, overweight men trying to take advantage of women from an economically poorer country. Because the Ukraine was a poor, war-torn country, these Western, Asian and Arabic men thought they could take advantage of Ukrainian women, tempting them away from their country into their beds. She wondered how many women actually had sex with these men. Others would write messages asking her if she liked to cook and clean, and asking to see pictures of her in her underwear. Sometimes she was tempted to send them something sexy. She was lonely after all and felt excited at the possibility of interacting with other men. Some men wanted to hear about her sexual fantasies. She would sit back in her chair and dream of having a man’s mouth between her legs, or about making love to a strong man in the ocean or on the beach. She dreamed about walking into a bar and having men stare at her beauty before choosing one of them and having sex with him in the toilets, or bringing him back to some luxurious hotel room for him to fuck her for hours, giving her multiple orgasms. But in the end she did not reply to these men either. She was a modest woman, confident in herself, but modest also. She never really imagined meeting a younger man. She wanted to talk to someone mature, a man who could understand her. But seeing Dan’s message in her inbox she got lost in his sincere blue eyes. They looked earnest and yet he seemed so sad to her. And he was the only man who wrote to her and asked her about her dreams in life. It was as though the other men only saw her as an inanimate object to be used. It was as though she was too old now to have dreams about the future and was better suited to becoming depraved in the present. Until she opened Dan’s message that is. She never would have thought that replying to his message would lead her here, to this pool and his perfect lips. </p>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="mySlides">
                            <p class="chapter-text">He kissed her again and again, playing with her tongue in his mouth, nibbling at her lips and licking her neck before asking, ‘do you want more?’ ‘Yes’, she replied almost out of breath. More involved Dan moving his mouth down her neck and along her collarbone to the middle of her chest, tracing his wet mouth down her sternum and between her full breast. When he got to the material of her blue bikini he moved his mouth back up and to the right, kissing and nibbling along her breasts where her flesh met the material of her swimsuit. She knew he was teasing her and allowed herself a soft moan to express her pleasure and want for more. By now, he had lowered himself down onto his elbows and held his head at breast-height admiring their ample size and softness. Without thinking about it, Yulia had begun to open the strings on her bikini and felt the bra loosen on her breasts as she willed him to move to her nipples that were burning with a desire to be caressed. But Dan was enjoying his exploring of her breasts and rather than moving to the nipple, he decided to circle over it and with his tongue he continued down along the outside of her left breast. He moved his mouth downwards again and kissed underneath her breast where the skin folded into her upper ribs. And then, to her surprise and pleasure, he took the weight of her breast on his tongue, balancing it there for a moment before licking slowly upwards. When his tongue met her nipple she moaned with pleasure and could feel her hips pressing ever further forward in search of more of his firmness. His tongue massaged her, circling round and round and sometimes allowing his teeth to scrape over the hard bulging nipple. Yulia was always proud of her body even if somewhat modest in nature. She had spent her youth training to be a professional ballet dancer and was now the owner of a ballet school. She knew her body was youthful for her age and she always felt strong and graceful. But to have a young man enjoy her body so much took her back a little. Even when she first met her husband, he had not enjoyed her then young body as much as Dan was right now, not just getting pleasure from her, but getting pleasure from giving it to her. He momentarily removed her breast from his mouth, looking up at her and taking the breast in his strong hand to squeeze her a little while gazing into her eyes and smiling. She just had to bend forward and kiss him again. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="chapter-text">She knew she would feel guilty, not just at the thought of having another man give her pleasure, but of simply opening herself up to someone new. Yulia was not sure if she deserved such pleasure. She felt guilty as she boarded the plane. She was nervous as well. How could she be so naïve, to travel to a foreign country, to a private villa in Croatia, to meet another man, a man that could be a creep or something worse? But she thought she could not be unlucky enough to meet someone as bad as her husband again. On the plane she felt free as she ordered a glass of wine and started to relax. ‘I was once beautiful’, she told herself, ‘but that beauty was a curse’. It is the reason why her husband controlled her so much. His jealousy was monstrous. He would not allow her to go out at night with her friends and did all that he could to control her movements. But as she grew older he became less interested in her. She smiled at the irony of it. Just as her husband started to think she was too old to attract another man, or too old to be interested in another, here she was flying away to a mysterious lover 21 years younger than her. But, of course, the guilt was still present in her stomach and as she felt Dan’s tongue caressing her breasts she thought briefly of her children and how the last person to extract pleasure from those breasts was her son when she breast fed him. But feeling guilty now was no use. Here she was lounging by the pool and with this young man’s mouth pleasuring her. All she could do was trust her instincts and allow herself the pleasure she was receiving. ‘Don’t I deserve it, after all?’, she reassured herself. </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mySlides">
                            <p class="chapter-text">He proceeded to pleasure her with his tongue, moving from her mouth to her other breast and beginning the process of enjoying her once again. ‘Please tell me you want more’, he begs her. ‘Yes, more’, she whispers to him. He continued his sensual dance, moving his lips down her rib cage and to her side where he finds a sensitive spot and draws a groan of bliss from her mouth once again. Yulia leans back and allows the morning sun to wash over her as he kisses her tummy and lower abdominals. She remembers when her body was so much firmer and she could trace her abdominal muscles with her finger. Now she is flat stomached and loose fleshed as Dan passes over her belly button. Her pleasure begins to shift, no longer concentrated in her chest she can feel the ache gathering between her legs as though there is an itch there that only Dan’s touch can satisfy. He moves his mouth down and inward, passing over the material of her bikini and moving as close as possible to her most sensitive place that craves for his tongue, but he makes no contact. He is teasing her again, building her anticipation ever more. ‘Just sink it into me’, she thinks as he moves down her thighs, licking upward along her pale skin and noticing the strength that she retains in her toned legs. He pauses again and looks up at her, passed her wonderful breasts and into her pale green eyes as he unties her bikini on one side and then the other. When he removes it completely she feels a heightened anticipation at the freedom she now experiences, sitting there completely naked with the most sensual of tongues between her legs. He moves his nose gently over her pubic hair, breathing in her scent and kissing down along the sides of her lips. She wonders briefly if she should have shaved completely, but seems pleased with Dan’s expression as he massages around her neatly trimmed and dark pubic hair. Finally, she thinks the moment has arrived as she sees his wide tongue protrude from his heavenly mouth. But he is teasing her again and runs his tongue up the length of her vagina without making contact. She breathes heavily out expecting him to kiss her again just above her clitoris. She can feel how wet she is and she is sure that he can smell her desire for him. To her surprise he does not move back to where she expects, and decides to move downwards again, this time pressing his tongue deep into her vagina, holding it there for a few seconds so that her fluid could gather on his tongue, and finally licking firmly upwards along her clitoris. She moans with the ecstasy of it. Looking down she can see him put his tongue back into his mouth and swallow. He had taken her wetness on his tongue and swallowed her. Smiling he tells her, ‘Yulia, you taste so good’, before diving in again and licking her clitoris. He refuses to settle into a pattern. Licking, kissing, nibbling and gently sucking on the lips of her vagina. Occasionally dipping his tongue inside of her, tasting her again and again. Yulia couldn’t take it anymore. It had been so long since she felt such pleasure that her stomach began to tighten and her legs squeezed against his head. She tried not to squeeze too hard, knowing that she might make him feel uncomfortable. But the intensity of her pleasure was building beyond her control. As she orgasmed she moaned loudly, her breathing sharp as the intensity between her legs becomes too much to bear. She feels her body convulse and shake as soon as she releases her abdominal muscles to allow the orgasm to flood into her being. Her thighs began to tremble and she clenched her fists down by her sides giving her body over to the ecstasy and allowing it to flow through her. She had not experienced such sensations in such a long time and feels that it is too much for her as Dan continues to press his tongue against her clitoris. She tried to pull herself away from his mouth to bring relief back into her body, but he presses his tongue once more into her trying to taste her again.  She finally gained some distance, arching her back and trying to recover her breathing once again. For a few moments the warmth of her pleasure continued to pulse through her body as she feels Dan’s strong hands firmly grasp her breasts as he kisses her thigh again. Regaining control of herself finally, all she can think to do is to slide into the water, throw her arms around him and thank him with her lips.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mySlides">
                            <p class="chapter-text">And how happy she felt then, under the warm sun and with this young man in her arms. She could sense his passion for her. It is a feeling she had not experienced before in her life. She was embarrassed to admit that fact, that at 52 years old Yulia, for the first time in her life tingled with sexual pleasure. His passion for her was real and she wondered if he lived his life with that same passion. ‘How wonderful would that be,’ she thought, to spend her life with a man who lived every moment of his life as though he was making love to a beautiful woman. Could he be that full of perfection? She could see it in his eyes, the pleasure he received from bringing her to orgasm. And when she got there, squeezing her thighs against his head he did not want to let go of her. He wanted to give her as much of that sensation as possible. He wanted to give her more pleasure than she could bear. She felt insatiable. She felt free in that pool and in his embrace, showering him with her kiss. She felt like anything was possible. And in that moment, she let any thoughts of her husband melt away from her mind because here she was in this moment feeling that it was entirely possible to spend the rest of her life with Dan and his passion for her. She knew she could be consumed and satiated by him. She knew deep down how naïve it was, to think she could have a life with this man. But she did not care. She also knew that the feeling of his tongue in her mouth, as well as his firm chest pressing against her was real, and if she could have it in this moment then why couldn’t she have it for every moment into the future? It was then, as she pressed herself up against him, that she realised Dan was still wearing his swimming trunks. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="chapter-subtitle-text">Dan</p>
                            <p class="chapter-text">Dan could hardly believe it when he saw her profile on the dating site. He could not believe how drawn to Yulia he was. He had recently lost his wife. There were complications during the birth of their daughter and they lost too much time. He lost them both. Since that moment, nine months ago he was covered in a veil of darkness. He had become disconnected from his friends and only sometimes saw his family. His father would call to his house often, but sitting upstairs at his desk, Dan would pretend not to be home. He could not take any more sympathy or advice about ‘talking to someone’. But as the months passed him by and he got back into his Web Design work, he found himself growing lonely again and longing for fulfilment. What had his marriage really been like after all? It was a working, functional relationship. There was love between him and his wife. They had met when they were both so young and fell into a passive love with each other shortly after getting married. He often found himself thinking of how his life could be different if he did not always do what was right, but if he did what he wanted to do with his life. Soon enough, his loneliness was replaced with a desire for something more. He still had a great passion burning within him and he became determined to fulfil it. He wanted to fill himself up again, but this time with a life of adventure and pleasure. And so he found himself online looking through hundreds of women’s profiles. There was really no end to the choice he had. Women from all over the world seeking love, romance and marriage. But when he saw Yulia’s profile he could not pass her by. She looked as lonely and longing as he felt. Her photographs were plain when compared to the other women on the site. She dressed conservatively and looked reticent and shy, as though she did not really belong in the world of online dating. And yet she had such confidence in her eyes. It intrigued him. Her photos may have been underwhelming, but he was still shocked when he saw her age. At 52 years old she looked ten years younger in her photos. Her auburn hair was light and her skin pale and youthful. And underneath her modest dress he could see a full and athletic figure. She was plain but somehow beautiful. And then there was the title she had written over her profile. A simple question, but one that drew him into her world. She wrote, ‘Are you passionate?’</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="mySlides">
                            <p class="chapter-text">In the pool, swimming towards her he felt her passion, his eyes drawn to her wonderful form as she sat at the side of the pool faintly smiling at him. He was not wrong about her looks and her body. Her breasts were big enough to fill his hands and he could see the muscles in her arms and legs. He wanted to kiss them badly. He wanted to find out just how passionate she was. And so he swam towards her, lifted himself out of the water, looked into her green eyes and kissed her softly. He could smell the sweetness from her skin and when she invited his tongue into her mouth he could taste her saliva, only able to think about how the rest of her would taste. Salty and sweet he imagined. She had been sitting in the sun watching him and could sense the beads of sweat gathering on her skin. And so started his exploration of her, licking her neck and feeling her head tilt when he kissed her earlobe. He knew she wanted him from the way she edged herself forward pressing her breasts up against his chest. And when she removed her bikini he delighted in seeing her round breasts hanging down a little, not quite as tight or as firm as a younger woman but so sensual to him. She was a real woman, a woman that had matured and grown gracefully into her body. He was surprised with how attracted he was to her. He looked upon her age and her mature figure with desire, as though her body was perfectly ripe for pleasure, perfectly matured and more sensual than a younger woman could ever be. He wanted to feel the weight in her body, and decided to take her breast on his tongue. He  was amazed at how something so soft could feel so heavy in his mouth. And when her breast collapsed back down into place, he could sense the weight and pleasure in it. He knew she was enjoying it. He searched for places that could draw a moan from her lips. She breathed out heavily when he kissed under her breasts and then moaned loudly when he covered her hard nipple with his lips and applied pressure to her pink flesh, massaging her nipples with his tongue. There was something very rewarding for him about being able to draw a reaction from her. He loved hearing her soft voice expressing her pleasure. He wanted her to talk to him, to tell him how badly she wanted him. And so when she said, ‘yes, more’, he knew he was free to taste between her legs. Running his tongue over her clitoris he could sense how wet she was. And so he pressed his tongue as deep as he could into her vagina and massaged her there for a few strokes feeling her fluid gathering on his tongue. Her taste filled his mouth as he found himself engrossed in her, licking up along her vagina again and revelling in how salty and yet sweet she tasted to him, making sure she saw him swallow her fluid and telling her how much pleasure she was giving him.  The truth was that Dan always gained more pleasure from giving pleasure than he did from orgasming himself. There was something very rewarding about being responsible for making a woman moan or even scream with pleasure. Sex with his wife was silent and he sensed that she did not really enjoy it. They would have sex just with the aim of climaxing, forgetting about the joy of the journey. Yulia’s body was made for exploring. He looked at the curves of her hips and her slim waist, and he reached up and squeezed her ample breasts knowing that hers was a body created for pleasure. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="chapter-text">Dan also loved to pleasure a woman with his mouth. He was fascinated by how a woman would taste, and how one woman could taste so much different to another. But it was more than that. He loved to feel the power in a woman’s body. He was a very practical man. Squeezing Yulia’s breasts allowed him to confirm just how real his experience was. How could it not be real? He liked to hold her breast and feel it’s physical weight. Running his hands over her waist and spreading his fingers out around her allowed him to confirm her physical dimensions. He imagined briefly, as he rubbed his nose over her clitoris, his hands squeezing and lifting her ass so that when he let go of her flesh he could feel its weight collapsing back into place. But to place your mouth between a woman’s legs was the ultimate pleasure. Dan could feel the power that Yulia held in her body as she squirmed in his mouth. Her legs were very strong from all of those years of ballet and she would press his head between them every few seconds. And when she got close to orgasm she grabbed his head in her hands and pulled him towards her allowing him to smother in the taste of her sex. Finally, she orgasmed, moaning loudly while reaching towards his mouth for that peak of pleasure. He knew that that pleasure was overpowering for her because she pressed powerfully into him before moving her hips away, moaning for him to stop. He always wondered why women would pull away like that rather than allowing him to continue to work with his tongue, maximising and riding the waves of pleasure. He wanted to talk to her about that, about what she experienced while his mouth was between her legs. He wanted to remind her of the irony, of how a woman would reach for the ultimate pleasure of orgasm only to pull back when she arrived there. And then shortly after the orgasm fades, she would be reaching for it again. He had seen movies and videos online of women who loved that intense sensation of orgasm. They would press themselves into the pleasure when it arrived, reaching further and further into it before collapsing from the exhaustion of it. He wondered why all women did not do this?</p>

                            <p class="chapter-text">As she slid into the pool and threw her arms around him, he saw that she had finally melted into a serenity around him now, no longer passive but having truly opened herself out for him. Her kiss was still sweet and the feeling of her body pressing up against him filled him with a desire to be inside of her. He could feel her passion. It was not just a passion for sexual stimulation, but one that went deeper than that. It was a passion for openness in all things from the fulfilling of carnal desires to the willingness to delve into emotional and spiritual bliss, to fold back the layers of complexity that envelopes human experience and to reveal a simple truth. ‘She does not kiss like a married woman,’ he thinks, remembering that she is in fact married to some man in the Ukraine who cannot make her happy. She did not talk to him about her husband or children. He guessed she did not need to, or perhaps she was trying to forget that she was married altogether. He wondered if she felt guilty at all? She kissed him again. Her eyes were bright and glowing. Her smile was shamelessly happy. She was as she should be when she realised that she is alone in her nakedness. Dan was so consumed by pleasuring her that he had not yet removed his swimming trunks, although his erection was so hard now that it felt like he could burst out of his trunks if he flexed his muscle a little. Yulia reached down and slid his shorts down his legs while kissing his chest. He was surprised at how ticklish and sensitive his chest was. No one had ever kissed him there before. She kissed him softly and gently, pressing her tongue against his chest and moving to his hard nipples. He felt himself laughing a little at the pleasure of it while he stepped out of his trunks. Yulia returned to his mouth, kissing him and uttering, ‘that’s better’. He loved how it felt to be naked in the water, to be unrestricted as Yulia continued to kiss him and grind her hips against him. She ran her fingers over his penis without closing her hand around him, but rubbing at his shaft with the palm of her hand. He was not sure whether she would be pleased with him. He was happy with his body. He was lean and toned and his penis was nice and long, almost reaching up as far as his belly button. He had started to exercise his penis. If he was to extract as much pleasure as possible from his new life, then he knew he would need to be able to give pleasure also and so he wanted to make his penis stronger and heavier. Every evening he would oil his penis and jelq for 30 minutes. Taking his slippery shaft between his thumb and index finger he would milk upwards from the base, squeezing the blood and pushing it into the cells. After a few months he noticed that it was thicker and felt heavier. Yulia closed her hand around it now. She was looking into his eyes to see if he approved of her touch. He could see she approved of his size, it was bigger than her hand and he could tell it was heavy in her palm. </p>

                            <p class="chapter-text">Taking a step forward Dan backed Yulia up against the edge of the pool and kissed her deeply, pressing his tongue into her mouth. As he did this, Yulia stroked down on his penis until she felt the foreskin slip back over his glands. ‘I need to be inside of you’, he told her. He placed his hand on her butt and squeezed her flesh, surprised with its firmness. Doing this, he lifted her up and she sat before him again at the side of the pool, inviting him into her by spreading her legs so that he could move inside of her. With her hands still stroking him, she guided his penis closer and closer until his glands massaged the opening of her vagina, which was once again wet for him. As his penis slid inside of her, she sighed with pleasure and he pressed himself all the way inside, feeling his hard penis touch the back of her vagina. He held it there inside of her as she pressed her hips forward, still wanting more of him. They embraced, kissed, ran each other’s hands over the other while Dan began to slowly massage her with his penis, moving slowly in and out, making sure his penis almost exits before entering her again. He was surprised by how tight her vagina felt around his shaft, as though his penis had expanded to fill her up inside. They stayed like that for some minutes, moving in and out of each other, with Yulia telling him ‘yes’ and Dan whispering ‘do you want more’, again to Yulia’s ‘yes, I love it’. He thought momentarily about Yulia’s openness as they made love and felt his excitement grow with the thought of all of the things he might do with her and to her as they developed their relationship. The excitement prompted him to thrust a little harder and deeper inside of her, again drawing a moan from her lips. He could feel her pleasure intensify as she wrapped her arms around his neck and drew him closer, kissing his ear as he thrusted into her. Her legs clenched around his waist. Dan knew she was not close to climaxing yet, but that her desire for him was immense and strong. He was amazed at how much she wanted him, like there was an itch inside of her that needed satiating. It made him speed his rhythm up, shortening his thrusts as he kissed her again, penetrating her wetness over and over while she moaned and kissed him back . That first time making love to her felt tumultuous and wild, both of them inflamed by their passion for the other. Dan could feel the pleasure swelling in his penis and he knew that he could not hold out much longer. He wanted to ease off but his excitement would not allow it as Yulia urged him onward towards his pleasure. He also wanted to cum inside of her. For him, that would be the ultimate connection with her, to feel himself ejaculating deep within her. But he was not sure if that was okay. She is 52 so he hoped that it would be okay, but did not want to be wrong. So as the pleasure raced through his penis he withdrew from her, spilling himself onto her stomach and losing the intensity of his orgasm. Yulia, reached down and started stroking him again and he felt a few more shudders of pleasure from her touch as he emptied himself onto her with her kissing him and telling him ‘yes’. </p>

                            <p class="chapter-text">Holding her again, their hot bodies engrossing one another in the cool water, Dan realised that this is the way it is supposed to be. It is the way it always should have been. This openness, this passion and freedom to give and to take pleasure from another, free of guilt and shame and judgment, this is the way relationships are supposed to be. It is the way life is supposed to be. Yulia leaned forward, and he once again felt the joy of her breasts against him. She leaned forwards and kissed his ear, whispering to him, ‘I spent my best years searching for you, but that’s okay now that I have found you’. Her words made him feel like spending the rest of his life with her. How amazing would that be, he wondered. How amazing to walk through his front door to find her there in his house waiting for him. He relayed the image to her and told her how much he likes it. ‘I will be waiting for you’, she says, ‘naked and wet, always naked and wet for you’. He felt guiltless, but still thought of his wife and her screams in the delivery room when her life was taken from her. He thought of his baby daughter, stillborn and beautiful. And then he looked into Yulia’s green eyes and wondered if he is looking at his future, or whether his guilt will return to consume him again. Or maybe her guilt will surface, or her husband and her family. They are just two strangers after all connecting in the clear water. </p>
